== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Where can I find the setting for this plugin? =

This plugin will add the settings to the Integration tab, to be found in the WooCommerce > Settings menu.

= I don't see the code on my site. Where is it? =

We purposefully don't track admin visits to the site. Log out of the site (or open a Google Chrome Incognito window) and check if the site is there for non-admins.

Also please make sure your GetRupert ID under WooCommerce -> Settings -> Integrations.

= My settings are not saving! =

Do you have SUHOSIN installed/active on your server? If so, the default index length is 64 and some settings on this plugin requires longer lengths. Try setting your SUHOSIN configuration's "max_array_index_length" to "100" and test again.
